Dashboard UI Link - https://we.tl/t-r6yUu5mxit

Create a dashboard(UI design attached) that allows users to create, view, and edit data related to a company's projects. The dashboard should consist of the following features:

A login page that allows users to sign in with their email and password. The login credentials should be authenticated using Firebase authentication.

Once the user is logged in, they should be directed to the main dashboard page, which displays a list of all projects. Each project should display its name, start date, end date, and a status indicator (e.g., green for "completed", yellow for "in progress", and red for "overdue").

The dashboard should allow users to add new projects by clicking a "New Project" button. Clicking the button should open a multi-level form that allows users to enter the project details. The form should have multiple steps, each with its own set of fields, and the user should be able to navigate back and forth between the steps.

The dashboard should allow users to edit existing projects by clicking on a project from the main dashboard page. Clicking on a project should open the same multi-level form used to create new projects, but with the project's current details pre-populated.

The dashboard should fetch project data from an API endpoint and store it in Firebase. Each project should have its own node in Firebase, with the project details stored as properties.

The dashboard should allow users to filter the project list based on their status indicator (e.g., "completed", "in progress", "overdue").

The dashboard should display project statistics, such as the number of completed projects, the number of projects in progress, and the number of overdue projects.

The dashboard should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes and devices.
